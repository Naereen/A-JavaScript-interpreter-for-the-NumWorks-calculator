[![Build](https://github.com/Naereen/A-JavaScript-interpreter-for-the-NumWorks-calculator/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Naereen/A-JavaScript-interpreter-for-the-NumWorks-calculator/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This apps lets you run a [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) script on your [NumWorks calculator](https://www.numworks.com)!

## Install the app

Installing is rather easy:

1. Download the latest `javascript.nwa` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/Naereen/A-JavaScript-interpreter-for-the-NumWorks-calculator/releases) page ;
2. This Release page is not-yet ready on this project, use [this folder instead](https://perso.crans.org/besson/publis/Numworks-apps/), and [this link](https://perso.crans.org/besson/publis/Numworks-apps/javascript.nwa) ;
3. Head to [my.numworks.com/apps](https://my.numworks.com/apps) to send the `nwa` file on your calculator (on Google Chrome browser). On [this page](https://my.numworks.com/python/lilian-besson-1/javascript) you will be able to also send a default example of a JavaScript file (a tiny test script), and you can edit it yourself later on, on your calculator.

## How to use the app

Just launch the app, and it will read and execute your script `javascript.py`!

This script should be located in the `javascript.py` file, that you can create, edit and save **from within your NumWorks!**.

If you want a demo, use [this `javascript.py` script](https://my.numworks.com/python/lilian-besson-1/javascript), that you can install on your NumWorks calculator, directly from their website (from my user space).

## Dependencies

This programs uses [the code generated by the Espruino project](https://github.com/espruino/Espruino/blob/master/README_Building.md#embedding-in-other-applications) (`espruino_embedded.c`, `espruino_embedded.h` etc), a portable JavaScript interpreter for microcontrolers.

## Build the app

To build this sample app, you will need to install the [embedded ARM toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain) and [nwlink](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nwlink).

```shell
brew install numworks/tap/arm-none-eabi-gcc node # Or equivalent on your OS
